  # specific configuration can be loaded by specifying active profile according to name of configuration file e.g. (limits-service-dev.yml)
  profiles:
    active: dev

# If I want to take the configuration from the Spring Cloud Config Server this file (application.yml)
# MUST BE RENAMED to -> (bootstrap.yml)

# --- bootstrap.yml is loaded before application.yml ---
#
# It is typically used for the following:
#
# 1) when using Spring Cloud Config Server, you should specify (spring.application.name) and
#    (spring.cloud.config.uri) inside bootstrap.yml
# 2) some encryption/decryption information
#
# Technically, bootstrap.yml is loaded by a parent Spring ApplicationContext. That parent ApplicationContext is loaded before the one that uses application.yml.
